The technologies used in the application: 
- HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the components and pages
- React.js for building user interfaces
- Fetch API to make requests to an external data source from Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest)
- Netlify for deployment
